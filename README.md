# Custom Allocators

This repository contains C code for custom allocators. The code is mostly for my own learning, and to get experience
publishing articles on the code I write.

During a summer internship, I was required to write a quick and dirty custom allocator for an experiment. I felt like
I didn't get as much time with it as I wanted, so I wanted to dive a bit deeper and try some implementations, and get
practice doing performance analysis by running tests on the different allocator implementations.

**TODO:** link to Medium article written about this code will go here
